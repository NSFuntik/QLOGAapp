<h2 id="process">PROCESS</h2>
<h3 id="enrollment">ENROLLMENT</h3>
<p>Users enrol on QLOGA by setting up their Account and accepting the
terms and conditions as detailed in this document. Once they are set up,
they will have the opportunity to complete the profile setup for the
different available QLOGA Services and accept the relevant terms and
conditions associated with each type of profile.</p>
<h2 id="qloga-services-terms-of-use">QLOGA Services Terms of Use</h2>
<p>These Terms of Use apply to your visit to and your use of the Website
and any future QLOGA mobile applications. As well as to all other
information, recommendations and/or services provided to you on or
through the Website, but for the avoidance of doubt these User Terms
apply to the Home services defined and described in the terms and
conditions for Providers and Customers. However, defined terms used in
this Part 2 shall have the meaning given in Part 1 unless otherwise
specified.</p>
<h3 id="contractual-relationship">CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP</h3>
<p>These Terms in Part 2 govern the access or use by you, an individual,
from within any country in the world of applications, websites, content,
products, and QLOGA Services (see <strong>“QLOGA Services”</strong> also
referred to as <strong>“Services”</strong>) made available by
EA-CONSULTI.CO, a private limited liability company established in
Scotland, having its offices on 113 1F2 Comiston Road, Edinburgh, EH10
6AQ, registered at the Scotland Chamber of Commerce under number SC
531951 (trade name <strong>“QLOGA”</strong>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCESSING OR USING THE QLOGA
SERVICES.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your access and use of the Services (see <strong>“QLOGA
Services”</strong>) constitutes your agreement to be bound by these
Terms, which establishes a contractual relationship between you and
QLOGA. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the
QLOGA Services. These Terms expressly supersede prior agreements or
arrangements with you. QLOGA may terminate these Terms or any Services
with respect to you, or generally cease offering or deny access to the
Services or any portion thereof, at any time for any reason. QLOGA will
provide you with as much notice as it reasonably can of such
termination, cessation or denial, being at least 24 hours notice.
However, QLOGA reserves the right to terminate these Terms or any
Services with respect to you, or generally cease offering or deny access
to the Services or any portion thereof, immediately at any time without
notice if (i) you are in breach of these Terms, (ii) it is impractical
to give such notice in the circumstances, or (iii) in QLOGA’s opinion,
any delay in such termination would expose QLOGA or a third party to
significant risk of harm or damage.</p>
<p>Supplemental terms may apply to certain <strong>“QLOGA
Services”</strong>, such as policies for a particular event, activity or
promotion, and such supplemental terms will be disclosed to you in
connection with the applicable Services. Supplemental terms are in
addition to, and shall be deemed a part of, the Terms for the purposes
of the applicable Services. Supplemental terms shall prevail over these
Terms in the event of a conflict with respect to the applicable
Services.</p>
<p>QLOGA may amend the Terms related to the Services from time to time.
Amendments will be effective upon QLOGA’s posting of such updated Terms
at this location or the amended policies or supplemental terms on the
applicable Service. Your continued access or use of the Services after
such posting constitutes your consent to be bound by the Terms, as
amended.</p>
<p>Our collection and use of personal information in connection with the
QLOGA Services is as provided in QLOGA’s Privacy and Cookie Policy
located at https://qloga.com/privacy.html. QLOGA may provide to a claims
processor or an insurer any necessary information (including your
contact information) if there is a complaint, dispute or conflict, which
may include an accident, involving any Customer and Provider and such
information or data is necessary to resolve the complaint, dispute or
conflict.</p>

<h2 id="your-use-of-the-qloga-services">YOUR USE OF THE QLOGA
SERVICES</h2>
<h3 id="user-accounts">User Accounts</h3>
<p>In order to use most aspects of the Services, you must register for
and maintain an active user Account. You must be at least 18 years of
age, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction (if different
than 18), to obtain an Account. However, those aged 14-17 may create an
account with permission of their legal guardian. Account registration
requires you to submit to QLOGA certain personal information, such as
your name, address, mobile phone number, date of birth and gender. You
agree to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date information in your
Account. Your failure to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date
Account information, may result in your inability to access and use the
Services or QLOGA’s termination of this Agreement with you. QLOGA does
not have access to Users´ passwords, instead using an external ID
provider that holds all Users´ emails and passwords. You are responsible
for all activity that occurs under your Account, and you agree to
maintain the security and secrecy of your Account username and password
at all times. Unless otherwise permitted by QLOGA in writing, you may
only possess one Account.</p>
<h4 id="account-closures">Account Closures</h4>
<p>Any User may close their Account at any time. This means the User’s
account will become inactive. In this instance, the Users will no longer
be searchable by any Providers or Customers. QLOGA will keep user data
for 10 years in alignment to GDPR data retention requirements.</p>
<h3 id="text-messaging">Text Messaging</h3>
<p>By creating an Account, you agree that the Services may send you text

the Services. You may opt-out of receiving text (SMS) messages from
QLOGA at any time by following the directions found at

<p>QLOGA may, in QLOGA’s sole discretion, permit you from time to time
to submit, upload, publish or otherwise make available to QLOGA through
the Services textual, audio, and/or visual content and information,
including commentary and feedback related to the Services, initiation of
support requests, and submission of entries for competitions and
promotions. Any User content (see “User content” definition) provided by
you remains your property. However, by providing User content to QLOGA,
you grant QLOGA a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable,
royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy,
modify, create derivative works of, publicly display, distribute,
publicly perform, and otherwise exploit in any manner such User content
in all formats and distribution channels now known or hereafter devised
(including in connection with the Services and QLOGA’s business and on
third-party sites and services), without further notice to or consent
from you, and without the requirement of payment to you or any other
person or entity.</p>
<p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and
exclusive owner of all User content or you have all rights, licenses,
consents and releases necessary to grant QLOGA the license to the User
content as set forth above; and (ii) neither the User content nor your
submission, uploading, publishing or otherwise making available of such
User content nor QLOGA’s use of the User content as permitted herein
will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s intellectual
property or proprietary rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or
result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.</p>
<p>You agree to not provide User content that is defamatory, hateful,
violent, libelous, pornographic, unlawful, obscene, or otherwise
offensive, as determined by QLOGA in its sole discretion, whether or not
such material may be protected by law. QLOGA may, but shall not be
obligated to, monitor, review, or remove User content, at QLOGA’s sole
discretion and at any time and for any reason, without notice to
you.</p>

International Chamber of Commerce Mediation Rules (see <strong>“ICC

to and shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration under
the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (see

Rules”</strong> Emergency Arbitrator provisions are excluded. The
Dispute shall be resolved by one (1) arbitrator to be appointed in
accordance with the ICC Rules. The place of both mediation and
arbitration shall be ABC Street, Edinburgh, EH1 1AB, United Kingdom
without prejudice to any rights you may have under Section B1, Rule
B1.9: Dispute Resolution of the Scottish Civil Code. The language of the
mediation and/or arbitration shall be English, unless you do not speak
English, in which case the mediation and/or arbitration shall be
conducted in both English and your native language. The existence and
content of the mediation and arbitration proceedings, including
documents and briefs submitted by the parties, correspondence from and
to the International Chamber of Commerce, correspondence from the
mediator, and correspondence, orders and awards issued by the sole
arbitrator, shall remain strictly confidential and shall not be
disclosed to any third party without the express written consent from
the other party unless:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the disclosure to the third party is reasonably required in the
context of conducting the mediation or arbitration proceedings,</p></li>
<li><p>the third party agrees unconditionally in writing to be bound by
the confidentiality obligation stipulated herein.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="applicable-law">APPLICABLE LAW</h2>

unenforceable, in whole or in part, under any law, such provision or
part thereof shall to that extent be deemed not to form part of these
Terms but the legality, validity and enforceability of the other
provisions in these Terms shall not be affected. In that event, the
parties shall replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or
part thereof with a provision or part thereof that is legal, valid and
enforceable and that has, to the greatest extent possible, a similar
