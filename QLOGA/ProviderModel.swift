I am so appreciated about our small talk in your cafe, that I wanna take a part in marketing assistance to your brand.  After some market research, I came up with a couple given strategies, which can promote your business.
First of all, I decided to offer you to develop a new product and come to market with some new more specific and deep taste, which can possibly enhance companyâ€™s makeover, but it reliable only with intensive marketing company that can increase your market share.
Secondly, as the most reliable,  it is a price reduction that will attract more customers, but will lead to lower profits and lower audience quality.
The last ones I prefers to merge in the same topic, because they way much expensive in time and money resources, but they certainly bring more profit. These are advertising and brand awareness campaigns that will have to attract a major amount of costumers and proposals.
On this basis, I want to conclude, that the most effective solution ffor the return of the former lost glory of  Caferoma will be the introduction of new product in the market, which itâ€™s competitors in the market havenâ€™t thought of yet, something original and one of exclusive offers, that will suppose to enticing  new opportunities and ideas to launch new successful products as well.
