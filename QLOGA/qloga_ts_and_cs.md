## QLOGA Services Terms of Use

These Terms of Use apply to your visit to and your use of the Website and any future QLOGA mobile applications. As well as to all other information, recommendations and/or services provided to you on or through the Website, but for the avoidance of doubt these User Terms apply to the Home services defined and described in the terms and conditions for Providers and Customers. However, defined terms used in this Part 2 shall have the meaning given in Part 1 unless otherwise specified.

### CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP

These Terms in Part 2 govern the access or use by you, an individual, from within any country in the world of applications, websites, content, products, and QLOGA Services (see **“QLOGA Services”** also referred to as **“Services”**) made available by QLOGA, a private limited liability company established in Scotland, having its offices on ABC Street, Edinburgh, ED1 1AB, registered at the Scotland Chamber of Commerce under number 1111111 (**"QLOGA”**). 

> PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCESSING OR USING THE QLOGA SERVICES.

Your access and use of the Services (see **“QLOGA Services”**) constitutes your agreement to be bound by these Terms, which establishes a contractual relationship between you and QLOGA. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the QLOGA Services. These Terms expressly supersede prior agreements or arrangements with you. QLOGA may terminate these Terms or any Services with respect to you, or generally cease offering or deny access to the Services or any portion thereof, at any time for any reason. QLOGA will provide you with as much notice as it reasonably can of such termination, cessation or denial, being at least 24 hours notice. However, QLOGA reserves the right to terminate these Terms or any Services with respect to you, or generally cease offering or deny access to the Services or any portion thereof, immediately at any time without notice if (i) you are in breach of these Terms, (ii) it is impractical to give such notice in the circumstances, or (iii) in QLOGA’s opinion, any delay in such termination would expose QLOGA or a third party to significant risk of harm or damage.

Supplemental terms may apply to certain **"QLOGA Services"**, such as policies for a particular event, activity or promotion, and such supplemental terms will be disclosed to you in connection with the applicable Services. Supplemental terms are in addition to, and shall be deemed a part of, the Terms for the purposes of the applicable Services. Supplemental terms shall prevail over these Terms in the event of a conflict with respect to the applicable Services.

QLOGA may amend the Terms related to the Services from time to time. Amendments will be effective upon QLOGA’s posting of such updated Terms at this location or the amended policies or supplemental terms on the applicable Service. Your continued access or use of the Services after such posting constitutes your consent to be bound by the Terms, as amended.

Our collection and use of personal information in connection with the QLOGA Services is as provided in QLOGA’s Privacy and Cookie Policy located at https://qloga.com/privacy.html. QLOGA may provide to a claims processor or an insurer any necessary information (including your contact information) if there is a complaint, dispute or conflict, which may include an accident, involving any Customer and Provider and such information or data is necessary to resolve the complaint, dispute or conflict.

## YOUR USE OF THE QLOGA SERVICES

You must be at least 18 years of age, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction (if different than 18), to obtain an Account.

You agree to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date information in your Account. Your failure to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date Account information, may result in your inability to access and use the Services or QLOGA’s termination of this Agreement with you. QLOGA does not have access to Users´ passwords, instead using an external ID provider that holds all Users´ emails and passwords. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account, and you agree to maintain the security and secrecy of your Account username and password at all times. Unless otherwise permitted by QLOGA in writing, you may only possess one Account.

You represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all User content or you have all rights, licenses, consents and releases necessary to grant QLOGA the license to the User content as set forth above; and (ii) neither the User content nor your submission, uploading, publishing or otherwise making available of such User content nor QLOGA’s use of the User content as permitted herein will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.

You agree to not provide User content that is defamatory, hateful, violent, libelous, pornographic, unlawful, obscene, or otherwise offensive, as determined by QLOGA in its sole discretion, whether or not such material may be protected by law.
